# Pure Math Notes

This is a repository that I pretend to keep expanding with all the knowledge I gather throught my math career. It'll contain links to every resource I deem to be useful, and also agda files that follow any material that I think might be interesting formalizing.

## The List

## Category Theory

- [Category Theory I](https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM): Great first course to get a taste of category theory with computer science in mind.
- [Category Theory II](https://youtu.be/3XTQSx1A3x8?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm): Significant jump in abstraction, still would recommend even if you are only for the computer science applications.
- [Category Theory III](https://youtu.be/F5uEpKwHqdk?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEn64WVX4B08B4h2rOtueWIL): Less jump in abstraction, however less applicable to computer science.
- [What is...category theory?](https://youtu.be/U56kGttITyI?list=PLuFcVFHMIfhKFQJsilw-W7dVtPprKU3-f): Concept-sized videos that are great for understanding the high-level idea.

## Algebraic topology & Homotopy theory

- [Algebraic Topology](https://youtu.be/kCTpfqRJ2kk?list=PLOROtRhtegr7DmeMyFxfKxsljAVsAn_X4) By Andrews University: Engaging first course in algebraic topology. Keeps it high level and easy to understand.
- [Algebraic Topology](https://youtu.be/nq8QBdP_N_o?list=PLpRLWqLFLVTCL15U6N3o35g4uhMSBVA2b) BY Pierre Albin: (Haven't watched yet)
- [Stable Homotopy Seminar](https://youtu.be/XaWPEmHdySs): (In progress)
- [Cubical Homotopy Theory](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/sites/doug-ravenel/otherpapers/munson-volic2.pdf): (In progress)
- [An Intuitive Introduction to Motivic Homotopy Theory](https://youtu.be/E3steS2Hr1Y) By the GOAT: motivic homotopy theory explained for non-specialists.

## ((Cubical) Homotopy) Type Theory

- [HoTT Lectures](https://youtu.be/u92V0OMgvhM?list=PL1-2D_rCQBarjdqnM21sOsx09CtFSVO6Z): Good first course but best with some category theory knowledge behind.
- [The Book](https://hott.github.io/book/hott-online-71-gc4e57d5.pdf): By far the best introductory text on Homotopy Type Theory (will go so far as to say it's my favourite math book that I've read). Hard, but manageable even without much prior knowledge.
- [MSRI Cubical Sets Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX4TYYUPcI0&list=PLCR1g38cGmgiaSzdjc_gxP-V-P--wbVWn&index=1): (In progress)
- [HoTTEST Lectures](https://youtu.be/HvYYCHMeM-8?list=PLtIZ5qxwSNnzpNqfXzJjlHI9yCAzRzKtx): (Not watched, but great channel in general)
- [Kan Simplicial Set Model of Type Theory](https://youtu.be/Y5Z5YlYnhc8): (Haven't watched yet)
- [Simplicial Types](https://youtu.be/DalYcHABM4U): Simplicial Types inside HoTT.

## (Higher) Topos Theory

- [Topos Theory](https://youtu.be/05AGavWtbbA?list=PLR6S6vLGnUbwLA1LiN5ctwXYQwyTXH0pg): Good first introduction but that obviously requires some category theory knowledge.
- [Category Theory - Toposes](https://youtu.be/Lkhz4B_UKdc?list=PL4FD0wu2mjWM3ZSxXBj4LRNsNKWZYaT7k): Fast-paced concrete descriptions of concepts in topos theory.
- [A crash course in topos theory: the big picture](https://youtu.be/Ro8KoFFdtS4): (In progress)
- [Higher Topos Theory](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/HTT.pdf): (In progress)

## (Linear) (Abstract) Algebra

(This is an area that I keep procrastinating)

- [Contemporary Abstract Algebra](https://www.toomey.org/tutor/text_books/Advanced/Contemporary%20Abstract%20Algebra%209th%20Edition%20-%20Joseph%20A.%20Gallian.pdf): (Not finished)
- [Topics in Algebra](https://marinazahara22.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/i-n-herstein-topics-in-algebra-2nd-edition-1975-wiley-international-editions-john-wiley-and-sons-wie-1975.pdf): (Not finished)
- [Abstract Algebra](https://youtu.be/VdLhQs_y_E8?list=PLelIK3uylPMGzHBuR3hLMHrYfMqWWsmx5): (Haven't watched, but seems pretty good)
- [Algebra](https://math24.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/algebra-serge-lang.pdf): (In progress)
- [Advanced Linear Algebra](https://youtu.be/ZrN0XKupRmA?list=PLOROtRhtegr4HyXIIHKHketOm2k3JWSpK): (In progress)
